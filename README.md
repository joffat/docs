# Socialgorithm Documentation

Welcome to the Socialgorithm documentation! 

This will give you a brief overview of the Socialgorithm competition infrastructure, and tell you how to use it to participate in or run competitions, or write integrations (e.g. challenges, games) for it.

Use the navigation on the left to reach sections of interest directly, or start with why you're here:
